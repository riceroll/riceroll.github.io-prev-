    With optimized printing tool paths and local layer height, 3D printed flat sheets can self‐transform into 3D shapes under heat.
    By viewing 3D printing as a programming system, we encode the internal morphing energy into the material through basic machine operations.
    We built an end‐to‐end tool that optimized the printing G‐code to enable flat sheets to self‐transform into arbitrary input height field. T
    he tool flattens the height field into a 2D layout with stress information using a geometry‐based optimization algorithm,
    and computes printing tool paths with a local path planning algorithm. Such a system enables rapid prototyping,
    flat‐packaging and self‐deployment.
#    Geodesy + is an end-to-end tool that enables an initially flat sheet to self-transform into the input height field.
#    The tool first flattens the height field into a 2D layout with stress information using a geometry-based optimization algorithm,
#    then computes printing tool paths with a path planning algorithm. Although FDM printing is the fabrication method in this work,
#    our approach can be applied to most extrusion-based printing methods in theory.
#    The results exemplify how the tool broadens the capabilities of 4D printing with an expanded shape space,
#    a low-cost but precise coloring technique, and an intuitive design process.

    SimuLearn is a data-driven method that combines finite element analysis and machine learning to create
    real-time (0.61 seconds) and truthful (97% accuracy) morphing material simulators.
    We use mesh-like 4D printed structures to contextualize this method and prototype design tools to exemplify
    the design workflows and spaces enabled by a fast and accurate simulation method.

    By taking advantage of the warpage that is commonly considered as a defect of desktop fused deposition modeling (FDM)
    3D printers, we have used an inexpensive 3-D printer to produce flat plastic items that, when heated,
    fold themselves into predetermined shapes, such as a rose, a boat or even a bunny.
    These self-folding plastic objects represent a first step toward products such as flat-pack furniture that
    assume their final shapes with the help of a heat gun. Emergency shelters also might be shipped flat and
    fold into shape under the warmth of the sun.

    We present 4DMesh, a method of combining shrinking and bending thermoplastic actuators with customized geometric algorithms
    to 4D print and morph centimeter- to meter-sized functional non-developable surfaces.
    With our tools, users can input CAD models of target surfaces and produce respective printable files.
    The flat sheet printed can morph into target surfaces when triggered by heat.

    From lizard tails to starfish arms, from grafted trees to human skin, living things in nature have long been
    utilizing the ability to “heal” their wounds on the soft bodies to survive in the outer environment.
    In order to impart this self-healing property to our daily life interface, we propose Self-healing UI,
    a soft-bodied interface that can intrinsically self-heal damages, reconfigure and fuse without external stimuli or glue.

    “We have been living with paper for more than two thousand years. It is a commodity that closely interfaces with human beings,
    even in this digital age. There have been several attempts at “tech paper innovation” over the past few years,
    for example, circuit ink printers and pens, but there has not yet been a huge innovation.
    However, the Printed Paper Actuator takes a new approach—not just printing circuit but actually kinetically working with paper.
    This innovation transforms the old media of paper and signals a new phase of media expression for industrial purposes (prototyping)
    and/or for pleasure (DIY for kids). These technological and material innovations take our idea of paper to the next level.”
