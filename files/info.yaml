intro: >-
  I am broadly interested in digital fabrication, computational design and human-computer interaction.
  I have been enjoying simulate and optimizing the fabrication process, including 3D printing,
  shape-changing material and origami. I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in CMU's Human-Computer
  Interaction Institute, advised by Lining Yao.
